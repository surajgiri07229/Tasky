  // Below method is used because we directly cannot store the data in localStorage
  // Many people use the localStorage and we have to provide an unique id to uniquely identify the stored objects... here tasky is unique id
  // If tasky is used by anyone else on the internet then there will be probability that it will come to local storage that is why we are using id uniquely

  //localStorage.setItem("tasky",globalStore); // localStorage represent my entire storage , setItem is one of the method of local storage... here we are setting the globalStore item to localStorage
 // inspect->Application->localStorage there it show key value pair and object of object(nested object - inside the object of object)
 // JSON.stringify() - It basically takes object of object and converts it into array of object simple it is
 // stringify takes some key value pair
   localStorage.setItem("tasky",JSON.stringify({cards:globalStore}));  // curly braces is there because it takes key value pair like dictionary //setItem basically sets the attribute or items that we passes to our local storage
  // The O/P will be {"cards":[{"id:2413425432", "imageUrl": image address}]}

// Issues like on refreshing the added card gets dissapears
//Adding functionality in edit and delete button

//API- Application Programming interface
// local storage- Accessing apllication via local storage..here we don't know DB implementation
// And we want to store the cards in local storage while refreshing no data loss we want
// Local storage implementation helps to dive into advance document object manipulation
//i= Interface - Interface is the middle man
